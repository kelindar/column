# Snapshot Example

This example reads a collection state from an existing snapshot `players.bin`, performs a simple query and saves a snapshot to a different file.

## Example output

```
snapshot: created an empty collection (0 rows)
snapshot: restoring from '../../fixtures/players.bin' ...
snapshot: restored 500 rows
snapshot: saving state into 'snapshot.bin' ...
```
